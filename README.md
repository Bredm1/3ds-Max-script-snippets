# 3ds-Max-script-snippets
A small library of small MAXscript snippets i made over the years. Most of them are very situational, but maybe just the right tool for someones 
problem so tought i share it them here.
Here some small description what script what supposed to do:

ABC_RANGE_CONTROL_01.ms
In 3ds max 2016, the alembic is very poorly implemented so a lot of times the range control is not working properly if you try to set it by hand.
Whit this you can easly set the wanted range by modifying the numbers then select the target abc then run the code.

Diff_setter_01.ms
With this, you can set the percentage of all diffuse materials in the material editor slots, even if its inside a multi material.

Self_Illum_setter_01.ms
With this, you can set the percentage of all selfillumination materials in the material editor slots, even if its inside a multi material.

Multimat_vray_to_Standard_01.ms
Converts Vray materials to Standard material.

LAYER_EXPLORER_SAVER_MAGIC_01.ms
Sometimes 3ds Max forgets to display the layers in the layer explorer properly, so with this script you can restore them. You have to select all object in the scene 
then run the script.
